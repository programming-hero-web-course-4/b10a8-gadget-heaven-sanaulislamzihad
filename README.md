## ✨ Key Features  

### 1. **Category Filtering**  
   - **Functionality**: Allows users to filter gadgets by categories like Phones, Laptops, Tablets, and Accessories.  
   - **Persistence**: Filters are saved, maintaining the user's context across sessions.  

### 2. **Cart and Wish List Management**  
   - **Cart**: Users can add selected gadgets to their shopping cart, with data saved using Local Storage.  
   - **Wish List**: Favorite gadgets can be stored for quick retrieval later.  

### 3. **Persistent Tabs**  
   - **Dashboard Tabs**: Users can switch seamlessly between `Cart` and `Wish List`, with selections retained even after page refreshes.  

### 4. **Sorting Options**  
   - **Price Sorting**: Gadgets can be sorted by price, helping users find products that fit their budget.  

### 5. **Data Persistence**  
   - **Local Storage**: Ensures that user preferences and selections are saved, even after the browser is closed.

## 📚 Core React Concepts Implemented  

### 1. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**  
   Enables writing HTML-like syntax within JavaScript for intuitive component structures.  

### 2. **Components**  
   - **Functional Components**: Stateless components built as functions.  
   - **Class Components**: ES6 classes for stateful components (less commonly used in modern React).  

### 3. **Props**  
   Used to pass data from parent to child components, enhancing reusability.  

### 4. **State Management**  
   Components manage internal data with React's state, ensuring dynamic rendering on updates.  

### 5. **Hooks**  
   - **useState**: Manages local component state.  
   - **useEffect**: Handles side effects, such as API calls or subscriptions.  
   - **useContext**: Simplifies data sharing between components without prop drilling.  
   - **useReducer**: Handles more complex state logic akin to Redux.  

### 6. **Conditional Rendering**  
   Renders components dynamically based on specific conditions, enhancing user experience.  

### 7. **Event Handling**  
   Manages user interactions, such as button clicks and form submissions.  

### 8. **React Router**  
   Implements navigation and routing for a smooth single-page application experience.  

### 9. **Render Props**  
   Passes functions as props to control how components are rendered dynamically.

## 🛍️ Future Enhancements  

1. **Enhanced Search Functionality**: Adding keyword-based search to quickly find gadgets.  
2. **User Authentication**: Allowing users to log in and save preferences to their accounts.  
3. **Pagination**: Efficiently display large datasets with a clean UI.  
4. **API Integration**: Replace static data with dynamic content fetched from an external API.
